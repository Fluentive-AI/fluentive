Hi, this is Jessica from Brandywine Homes. You've reached the right place. How can I assist you today? 
Lead:
Hey Jessica, nice talking to you. So I'm looking for a new house to rent in the coming month. I'm moving to McDonough near Atlanta, and I'm trying to find something for my wife and my two kids.
Jessica:
So three bedroom that's pets friendly. And I know something around 17 to 1800 per month. So I was wondering what you may have available. 
Lead:
Hey Ethan, it's great talking to you too. I completely understand what you're looking for. A three bedroom home in McDonough, Georgia That's pet friendly and suitable for a family of four.
Jessica:
I have two great ideas for you and your family. First, we have 456 Oak Avenue. It has three bedrooms and two bathrooms. It's 1, 300 square feet in total and the rent is 1, 750 per month. It is very cozy and has a beautiful sunroom and a well lit living room and pets are allowed. Otherwise, we have 789 Pine Lane.
Lead:
This one has three bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms. It is slightly larger at 1, 380 square feet and the rent is 1, 800 per month. This one is a beautiful white house with a tree in a front yard. There is a cozy fireplace in the living room and pets are also allowed. What do you think? Would you like me to send over some information via text or email?
Jessica:
We can also directly go ahead and schedule a tour if you'd like. 
Lead:
Yeah, actually, you know what both options sound good. So yeah, maybe I'd like to go ahead and visit them if that's possible. Do you know when you'd have availability to schedule a visit for both of them on the same day? 
Jessica:
Okay, that sounds good.
Lead:
I see a few available time slots in the coming days that would allow you to visit both at the same time. I have a few available slots next week. Tuesday, March 18th at 10am Thursday. March 20th at 2pm. Saturday, March 22nd at 1pm. 
Jessica:
I'm guessing Thursday sounds good. Can you send me all that information by text?
Lead:
And also go ahead and schedule that tour for me. So my number would be 646 250 3816 And you can schedule that for Ethan Rosenblum if that's possible. 
Jessica:
Okay, that sounds great. I will go ahead and send you all details by text. Thank you for taking the time today and I'm looking forward to hearing what you think about the homes.
Lead:
That sounds great. Thank you very much, Jessica.
